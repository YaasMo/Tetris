# Welcome to Tetris!

I created this game on my path to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript during the Summer of 2020. 
Initially, I got the inspiration from a freeCodeCamp tutorial, and built up the user 
interface and elements of the game from there. I hope you enjoy playing it and let me
know what you think! **The game is available at [this link](https://yaasmo.github.io/Tetris/).**

Enjoy!
